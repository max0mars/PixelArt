# PixelArtGame


A simple Pixel Art game coded in Java.
When run creates two windows, a black canvas to draw on and a palette to select colors. 
Each of the colors has a coresponding number. On the palatte, you will find a few presets that will fill the canvas with numbers to help guide you, or a clear button to clear the canvas.
